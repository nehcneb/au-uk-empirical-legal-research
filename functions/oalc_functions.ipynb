In these two proceedings the adult sons of the late Stanley Athol Brand seek family provision orders from his estate pursuant to Section 59 of the Succession Act 2006.\\n2. The plaintiffs are half-brothers. Their mothers were the first and second wives respectively of the testator. The evidence has satisfied me that, to some extent during his life, and particularly in the distribution of his estate, the testator’s attitude towards his sons was not merely lacking in generosity, but it was unfair and inconsistent with the standards of a wise and just father cognisant of the circumstances of his sons. He was clearly disappointed by them – apparently only because neither had made a financial success of their lives - but for no other apparent reason. There was really no evidence of any sound, justifiable or rational ground for ignoring his sons’ moral claims on his benevolence, especially given the difficult lives that they had experienced and the circumstances in which they found themselves at the date of death of their father. I have also taken into account, as I am required to do for the purpose of determining what is appropriate, their circumstances as at the date of the hearing.\\n\\n\\nThe Will\\n3. The testator made his last will on 27 February 2013 and died on 26 May 2013. His estate at the time of his death was relatively modest and its primary asset was an unencumbered property located in Bishops Bridge. The property was sold in December 2013 and the net proceeds of sale were $604,978.19.\\n4. Counsel for the plaintiff (Peter) provided a breakdown of the assets of the testator’s estate including his notional estate. The figures were not disputed by the other parties and are as follows:\\n        Estate assets:\\n        Realty sold for $625,000\\n        CBA account $ 2,625\\n        Nett proceeds of estate $ 598,840.11\\n        held in trust account as at\\n        26 March 2014\\n        Notional estate assets:\\n        Section 79 Succession Act 2006\\n        Proceeds of sale of personalty $ 5,700.00\\n        nett distributed/held by executor\\n        Cash withdrawn from account $ 30,000.00\\n        distributed to beneficiaries by\\n        George Brand before probate\\n        Nett estate and notional estate: $634,540.11\\n        Potential estate liability: $ 62,066.01\\n        mortgage of June Marjory Doyle\\n        at the completion of the sale of 3\\n        Willunga Close, Ulladulla, 15\\n        August 2014 if paid from estate\\n5. At the hearing, counsel for the defendant informed me that $583,573 is currently held in the trust account for the estate of the testator.\\n6. By his will the testator divided his estate into thirds. He gave a legacy of one third of the estate to his nephew (George), who is the executor of his will and the defendant in these proceedings. He directed that the remaining two thirds be used to discharge the mortgage over the testator’s first wife’s property, with the balance to be divided equally between the plaintiffs, (Peter and Stephen); three of the testator’s nephews (Barry Roy Brand, Geoffrey Brand and Terry James Brand); and his niece (Jennifer Ann Brand). The approximate amount to which each son is entitled according to the will is $61,000. As the above schedule shows, the defendant distributed $30,000 before probate was granted. I deal with this more fully in paragraph [35] below.\\n\\n\\nPeter’s Circumstances\\n7. Peter is the testator’s youngest son and a child of his second marriage. He is 51 years old, married to his second wife and the father of six children. He resides with his wife and five of their children in a three bedroom dwelling in Rutherford provided by the Department of Housing. Rent is $200 per week. Peter has never owned his own home.\\n8. Peter is presently employed on a casual basis as a console operator at a petrol station and earns a gross monthly income of $4,028. His wife is a homemaker and carer for the children. She receives approximately $400 per month calling bingo once a week at a local Leagues Club. The household receives a Family Tax Benefit for the children of $1,404 per month.\\n9. At the age of 17 Peter joined the Royal Australian Air Force and served for just over 11 years. During his time in service Peter accrued $91,900 in Military Superannuation. This is his primary asset. In 1986 Peter married his first wife. They had one child who is now 25 years of age and does not reside with Peter. In 1989 Peter and his first wife separated.\\n10. After leaving the RAAF in 1992 Peter worked in various low income earning jobs including as a trade’s assistant with a builder in the Canberra region, as a spray painter and at a Holden dealership in Ulladulla. In or around 1995 he met a woman named Claire and commenced a relationship. During their relationship Peter and Claire had two children. After separating from Claire in 2002, Peter gained full custody of both children. One child spends four nights per fortnight with her mother, while the other lives with Peter and his current wife on a permanent basis at the Rutherford property.\\n11. In 2000 Peter suffered an injury to his lumbar spine after falling down stairs in his home. This resulted in partial damage to L3/4, L4/5, L5/S1, disc damage, and resultant chronic low back pain. He has reduced ability to sit or stand for long periods, and difficulty bending and lifting. As a result of this injury, Peter’s capacity to work is limited. He also suffers from epilepsy, and has experienced seizures during his sleep. Because of this condition he is not permitted to operate heavy machinery or hold a heavy vehicle licence.\\n12. After his father became ill in 2003, Peter and his two eldest children moved in with his father at his home in Bishops Bridge. Although his father would occasionally sleep at his partner’s house I am satisfied that the four lived together as a family unit until early 2007. During this time Peter assisted his father with maintaining and improving the property and there is no reason to doubt his assertion that during this time he and his father had a good relationship. In 2006 Peter met his second wife. In August 2007 they were married. They have since had three children – the youngest born in January 2015.\\n13. Despite not speaking to his father about his will or his assets Peter assumed that reasonable provision would be made for him in his father’s will, especially given his limited financial circumstances. This was an appropriate expectation. Indeed, the defendant concedes that the will does not make adequate provision for Peter and, prior to the hearing, made an offer of further provision in the sum of $91,000. Peter submits however that adequate and appropriate provision for his needs would be an amount sufficient to enable him to purchase his own home and have a fund for future needs. He estimates that this amount would be up to $350,000.\\n\\n\\nStephen’s Circumstances\\n14. Stephen is the eldest son of the testator and a child of his first marriage. He is 63 years old and works two days a week as a volunteer for St Vincent de Paul. Stephen’s only source of income is a New Start allowance. His wife receives a carer’s pension of $705 a fortnight. Stephen suffered a mild stroke in 2007 and takes medication to treat diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Stephen and his wife rent a property at South Ulladulla for $280 per week. During the week their granddaughter stays with them, as she is unable to be adequately cared for by her mother.\\n15. Stephen had a dysfunctional childhood and was a disappointment to his father. After his parent’s divorce in 1960, Stephen attended The King’s School. His fees were paid by his father, who complained frequently to his young son about the amount of the fees. During his first two years at King’s, Stephen lived with his father’s friends at Guildford and was periodically beaten by his father’s male friend. Stephen spent his holidays with his mother and her new husband in Milton. At the instruction of his father, Stephen delivered money from his father to his mother. When handing his mother the money, he was told by his father to say ‘Here’s your blood money Mum’. For some of the time Stephen resided with his father and his new wife in Ettalong and commuted to King’s in North Parramatta. This was an arduous journey and eventually caused him to leave the school prematurely.\\n16. In 1968 Stephen moved to Sydney and worked as a clerk. In 1971 he left clerical work and followed in his father’s footsteps by becoming a bricklayer. During this time he generally contacted his father on a weekly basis. In 1981 he moved to Milton. In 1984 Stephen met his wife and in 1985 they moved to Sydney so that he could work as a customs officer.\\n17. In or about 1988 or 1989 Stephen purchased a property in Ulladulla through HomeFund, which was a state government mortgage lending institution. This proved to be an unfortunate investment decision by Stephen as HomeFund shortly afterwards collapsed. Stephen unsuccessfully used his superannuation to attempt to repay the mortgage over the property. Eventually the government wiped the debt and sold the property.\\n18. In 1996 Stephen and his wife moved back to Milton to look after Stephen’s sick mother. The house in Milton was sold in 1997 and Stephen’s mother purchased a smaller and more manageable property in Ulladulla. After this relocation, Stephen, his mother and the testator began to visit each other in their respective homes. During this time, and until his death, Stephen’s father developed the habit of telephoning every Sunday morning to talk to Stephen and his mother. As his mother and father became friendlier, Stephen recalls his father expressing regret that his second wife had received a better divorce settlement than his mother (the first wife). In 2004, Stephen’s mother took out a reverse mortgage on the property in Ulladulla to raise sufficient funds to enable her to renovate the garage into a granny flat. The testator wished that his first wife’s reverse mortgage be repaid from his estate.\\n19. In August 2013 Stephen’s mother died, two weeks after probate of his father’s will was granted to the defendant. Stephen and his wife were the executors and beneficiaries named in his mother’s will. The estate’s primary asset was the property in Ulladulla, which was valued at $320,000. Notwithstanding the fact that the mortgage of $58,000 was to be paid out of his father’s estate, Stephen sold the property in Ulladulla for $305,000 in July 2014. This does not appear to have been a wise financial decision. After payment of the mortgage and sale expenses, Stephen and his partner received a net sum of $230,000. Stephen and his wife deposited $110,000 of the proceeds in a savings account, purchased a $45,000 demountable home in a caravan park for their daughter, a $15,000 car, a $2,000 car, spent $5,000 holidaying in Tasmania and paid legacies of $3,000 to each of their daughters as they were beneficiaries of the will. The balance of the proceeds can no longer be accounted for.\\n20. Like his half-brother, Stephen also seeks sufficient provision from his father’s estate to enable him and his wife to purchase their own home. He expected that his father’s estate would be split evenly between the defendant, Peter and himself.\\n\\n\\nFreedom of Testamentary Disposition\\n21. Freedom of testamentary disposition is a fundamental principle of our legal system: Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales (1961-62) 107 CLR 9 at 19; Vigolo v Bostin (2005) 221 CLR 191 at [10]; Madden-Smith v Madden (Estate of the late Doris Linda Madden) [2012] NSWSC 146 at [30]-[34]; Goodswell v Wellington [2011] NSWSC 1232 at [108].\\n22. As I said in Madden-Smith v Smith (supra):\\n        32. There are sound practical reasons for not encroaching too readily on the testator’s freedom of testamentary disposition and especially not in accordance with abstract concepts such as fairness or the misguided notion that there should be equality between the children of the testator. In Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales (supra) at 20, Dixon CJ articulated the unique difficulty which these cases present with the following memorable apophthegm:\\n                    The difficulty is that the Court itself can never be certain that it knows all the circumstances. More often than not, one may be sure that the Court knows few of them. Experience of forensic contests should confirm the truth of the common saying that one story is good until another is told, but a testator is dead and cannot tell his.\\n        33. To similar effect were some observations of Taylor J in Stott v Cook (1960) 33 ALJR 447 at 453-4, who explained that the reason why a court does not have a mandate to rework a will according to its own notions of fairness, is because such an approach would serve justice no better than:\\n                    …acceptance of the judgment of a competent testator whose knowledge of the virtues and failings of the members of his family equips him for the responsibility of disposing of his estate in far better measure than can be afforded to a Court by a few pages of affidavits sworn after his death and which only too frequently provide but an incomplete and shallow reflection of family relations and characteristics.\\n23. In cases such as this the role of a court is not to ride roughshod over a testator’s intentions, but only to alter the will to the extent that adequate provision is not made for the eligible person, for whom a testator has failed in his or her moral duty: Wilcox v Wilcox [2012] NSWSC 1138 at [23]. The process is deductive, not intuitive. There is only a warrant for making an award (and altering the will) when the statutory criteria have been established.\\n\\n\\nAdequate and Proper Provision\\n24. In Singer v Berghouse (1994) 181 CLR 201 and later in Vigolo v Bostin (supra) the High Court held that in determining whether a family provision order should be made, the court should conduct a two-stage inquiry. The first stage involves a determination of whether the provision applicable in the absence of intervention by the court is ‘adequate’, and the second stage requires the court to engage in a discretionary exercise to determine what provision ought to be made: See also Andrew v Andrew [2012] NSWCA 308 at [69] – [71] (per Barrett JA)\\n25. Section 59(1)(c) of the Act is a codification of the first stage of this approach. It provides that a family provision order may only be made in relation to the estate of a deceased person if the court is satisfied that adequate provision for the proper maintenance, support, education or advancement in life of the plaintiff has not been made by the will of a deceased person.\\n26. The term ‘adequate’ and especially the term ‘proper’, are value laden concepts. They cannot always be neatly divided but in general terms, the former is concerned with quantum while the latter directs attention to what is appropriate in all the circumstances: Madden-Smith v Madden (supra) at [36]; Alexander v Jansson [2010] NSWCA 176. In Goodman v Windeyer (1980) 144 CLR 490, Gibbs J at 502 stated:\\n        The words ‘adequate’ and ‘proper’ are always relative. There are no fixed standards, and the court is left to form opinions upon the basis of its own general knowledge and experience of current social conditions and standards.\\n27. What is proper turns on whether a wise and just testator, aware of all the circumstances, would have thought it his or her moral duty to do more: Vigolo v Bostin (supra) at [15] – [22]; Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co (Ltd) [1983] AC 463 at 479; Goodsell v Wellington (supra) at [56] – [72]; Madden-Smith v Madden (supra) at [36]. I gratefully adopt the following statement in Verzar v Verzar [2014] NSWCA 45 at [39]:\\n        Whether [adequate] provision has been made requires an assessment of the applicant’s financial position, the size and nature of the deceased’s estate, the relationships between the applicant and the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon his or her bounty and the circumstances and needs of those other persons: see Tobin v Ezekiel [2012] NSWCA 285; 83 NSWLR 75 at [70] and McCosker v McCosker [1957] HCA 82; 97 CLR 566 at 571-572; Singer v Berghouse [1994] HCA 40; 181 CLR 201 at 210; and Vigolo v Bostin [2005] HCA 11; 221 CLR 191 at [16], [75], [112]. Such an assessment is necessary because of the inter-relation between ‘adequate provision’ and ‘proper maintenance’. Whilst the inquiry as to what is ‘adequate’ directs particular attention to the needs of the applicant, what is ‘proper’ requires regard to all the circumstances of the case, and in particular the size and nature of the estate and the needs of the other beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries.\\n28. The determination of what is adequate provision for a plaintiff’s proper maintenance, support and advancement in life requires consideration of the relativities. It also involves an evaluative judgment having regard to a plaintiff’s station in life and the standard of living he or she is entitled to expect: Madden-Smith v Madden (supra) at [36].\\n29. Sections 59(2) and 60(1)(b) of the Act are analogous to the second stage of the approach enunciated by the High Court. They provide that the court may make such order for provision out of the estate of the deceased person as it thinks ought to be made for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life of the plaintiff, having regard to the facts known to the court at the time the order is made. This is an evaluative judgment which arises from the word ‘ought’ and requires examination of the applicant’s needs: Gwenda Jane Toth v Ronda Sedelia Graham [2014] NSWSC 393 at [10(8)].\\n\\n\\nSection 60(2) Factors\\n30. Section 60(2) of the Act sets out the matters that may be considered by the court in determining whether to make a family provision order. Those matters include:\\n             1. any family or other relationship between the applicant and the deceased person, including the nature and duration of the relationship;\\n             2. the nature and extent of any obligations or responsibilities owed by the deceased person to the applicant, to any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or to any beneficiary of the deceased person’s estate;\\n             3. the nature and extent of the deceased person’s estate (including any property that is, or could be, designated as notional estate of the deceased person) and of any liabilities or charges to which the estate is subject, as in existence when the application is being considered;\\n             4. the financial resources (including earning capacity) and financial needs, both present and future, of the applicant, of any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or of any beneficiary of the deceased person’s estate;\\n             5. if the applicant is cohabitating with another person the financial circumstances of the other person;\\n             6. any physical, intellectual or mental disability of the applicant, any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or any beneficiary of the deceased person’s estate that is in existence when the application is being considered or that may reasonably be anticipated;\\n             7. the age of the applicant when the application is being considered.\\n31. In his analysis of section 60(2) in Toth v Graham (supra) Kunc J said at [10(11)], and I gratefully adopt:\\n        (11) Section 60(2)(p) confirms the breadth of matters the Court can take into account. Once enlivened, the Discretion is expressly fettered only by the requirement in s 59(2) that if an order is made, it must be such order ‘as the Court thinks ought to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person, having regard to the facts known to the Court at the time the order is made’. The Discretion is otherwise unconfined, which means that in answering question (9) the Court is otherwise constrained only by the need to act judicially, that is to say ‘not arbitrarily, capriciously or so as to frustrate the legislative intent’: Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at [22] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ. The Court must act rationally and exercise the Discretion for the purpose for which it was conferred.\\n\\n\\nAppropriate Award\\n32. Applying these principles, I am quite satisfied that adequate provision has not been made in the testator’s will for Peter and Stephen. I have reached the conclusion that a wise and just testator in the position of the deceased would have recognised the genuine needs of his sons and made greater provision for their proper maintenance, support, education or advancement in life.\\n33. In the case of Peter, although he did not make a financial success of his life, which disappointed his father, I am satisfied that they had a good relationship – which makes the parsimony of the provision made by the testator in his will, even less explicable. They appear to have communicated regularly until the date of the testator’s death. And Peter was always willing to support his father whenever called upon. When his father became ill in 2003, Peter saw it as his responsibility as a son to live with and care for his father. During this period Peter also assisted in the maintenance of his father’s home. The testator’s obligation becomes more apparent upon scrutiny of Peter’s financial circumstances, which would have been known to the testator. Peter’s financial situation is hapless. Due to his spinal injury and epilepsy, his capacity to earn an income and provide for his large family is diminished. His wife has also recently had another child. Their current home of three bedrooms houses seven family members. Without further provision, and barring some unforseen good fortune, Peter and his wife are likely to experience significant hardship in providing for their children.\\n34. Stephen, like his half-brother, had a tolerably good relationship with his father notwithstanding the latter’s disappointment in him. From a young age, Stephen regularly conformed to his father’s demands and made numerous sacrifices throughout the course of his life to please him. In the testator’s latter years, his affinity for Stephen and particularly to Stephen’s mother increased, and they shared a bond as a family.\\n35. Although Stephen is more financially secure than Peter, Stephen and his family have reasonable financial needs that neither he, nor his wife, can satisfy. Stephen is unemployed, and his age and state of health diminish his capacity to earn an income. He and his wife also care for their granddaughter, who is unable to be properly cared for by her mother. Stephen did of course inherit a substantial sum of money from his mother’s estate and as a result has over $100,000 of accessible savings. This factor, coupled with the number of dependants Peter has to provide for, leads me to conclude that Peter has a greater need for provision than Stephen.\\n\\n\\nPrior Distributions\\n36. Before the commencement of the hearing the defendant made the following distributions from the estate of the testator:\\n37. (a) $12,500 to himself;\\n38. (b) $3,333 to each the plaintiffs;\\n39. (c) $4,053 to each Barry Brand, Geoffrey Brand and Terry Brand; and\\n40. (d) $3,933 to Jennifer Brand.\\n41. I was also informed that the defendant distributed $200 and $240 to two non-beneficiaries of the testator’s will in return for assistance they provided the defendant on the date of the auction of the testator’s property. The total amount of the testator’s estate distributed prior to the hearing was $35,698.\\n\\n\\nOther Beneficiaries\\n42. Counsel for the defendant conceded that the other beneficiaries named in the will would suffer no hardship if the will were altered in such a way as to deprive them of the whole, or substantially the whole, of the legacies left to them. This is particularly the case with the defendant, who is wealthy. It is not necessary to enumerate his assets and their value, but it was obvious during his evidence that he had not been full and frank about his financial position. Several properties were not accounted for in his statement of assets. He was not an impressive witness.\\n43. The testator’s benevolence towards the defendant, at the expense of his sons, reflected his friendship towards him, rather than the defendant’s needs. I acknowledge that in the early 1990s the defendant provided $60,000 the testator to assist him to acquire his property at Bishops Bridge. This was a gift, for which the defendant did not expect or require repayment. Nonetheless, the testator appears to have intended, in effect, that the defendant be repaid from his estate. While this may be understandable, the circumstances of the sons made their requirements, and the testator’s moral obligation, greater.\\n44. In my view, it is in the interests of justice that, save for the notional estate that has already been distributed, the testator’s remaining estate be divided between Peter and Stephen in the ratio of 60:40. The fact is that Peter and Stephen have limited financial resources and obvious financial needs, while the defendant is financially secure. And despite being informed of the plaintiffs’ claims, none of the other beneficiaries put on any evidence from which an inference of hardship might be derived. The contrary inference is more probable. Counsel for the defendant made no submission against that conclusion. I am therefore satisfied that the orders I propose to make will not cause hardship to any of the other beneficiaries named in the testator’s will. There are sound pragmatic reasons for leaving the notional estate in the hands of those who have already received distributions. My orders are not intended to affect the receipt of monies by those persons to whom prior distributions have already been made.\\n\\n\\nOrders and Costs\\n45. For those reasons, I make orders as follows:\\n         1. The costs of the plaintiffs be paid out of the estate on an ordinary basis.\\n         2. The costs of the defendant be paid out of the estate on an indemnity basis.\\n         3. The net balance of the estate remaining after the payment of the amounts in (1) and (2) above, be paid as to:\\n             1. 60% to Peter Leslie Brand;\\n             2. 40% to Stephen John Brand.\\nDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

This is a family provision claim by a woman who met Robert Kingsbury (the testator) when he was aged 56 years and she was 37 years. They had a relationship of some sort but both kept their financial affairs quite separate and the plaintiff made no monetary contribution to the testator’s expenses of life. When the testator died in November 2013 aged 83 years, he left a will that provided for the division of his estate between his daughter and the plaintiff. Unfortunately, the plaintiff is not satisfied with that division and wants more, even though the testator’s daughter and her husband have negligible income, almost no assets and do not own their own home. In contrast, the plaintiff owns real estate at Buderim in Queensland, earns a gross salary of $95,050 per annum in full time employment as a social worker, has a superannuation balance of approximately $233,017 and has recently received $179,320 from the estate of her late father. Admittedly, she is now approaching the end of her working life.\\n2. The principal asset of the estate is a property at Lilyfield. Its estimated value is between $1.25 million to $1.45 million. The value of the gross distributable estate is likely to be between $1 million and $1.25 million. By his will, the testator directed that his Lilyfield property, which the plaintiff had come to share with him as her residence, be sold within six months of his death and that the net proceeds of sale be apportioned as to one-third to the plaintiff and two-thirds to his daughter.\\n3. The plaintiff’s principal factual contention is that ‘she does not wish to move from the Lilyfield property’. She adds however that, if the property must be sold as the testator directed, she should be entitled to a house, not an apartment; close to Lilyfield; with a garden; with room for her cats; with at least two bedrooms so that she has a study and space for visitors; in good repair and otherwise of reasonable amenity. She also seeks a fund to meet contingencies. In pursuit of this claim she has spent an inordinate sum – in excess of $100,000 – in legal fees and expenses, all of which she says she should recover (on the ordinary basis) from the assets of the estate – whether she wins or loses.\\n4. For the reasons that follow, I have reached the conclusion that it would be contrary to law to accede to the plaintiff’s claim. Her litany of requirements, if granted, would not merely flout the reasonable, fair and rational scheme of testamentary disposition that the testator intended, but would operate to the serious disadvantage of the testator’s daughter and her husband, without being at all justified by the statutory criteria specified in Chapter 3 of the Succession Act 2006.\\n\\n\\nThe Legal Principle\\n5. This is a suitable occasion to reiterate that the court’s intervention in these cases is limited only to those situations where there has been a failure in the circumstances to make ‘adequate’ and ‘proper’ provision for an eligible person to whom the testator owed a moral obligation. Those advising claimants should bear in mind that courts steadfastly resist the temptation to rewrite the will of a deceased person simply because it appears to be unfair, unequal or unwise. Fairness and equality are not touchstones for relief under the Succession Act.\\n6. In Hughes v National Trustees, Executors & Agency Company [1979] HCA2; 143 CLR 134 at 146, Gibbs J said:\\n        ... the court is not entitled to re-write a will of a testator in accordance with its own ideas of fairness or justice.\\n7. In Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales (1961-62) 107 CLR 9, Dixon CJ explained, at 19:\\n        The Court is given not only a discretion as to the nature and amount of the provision it directs but, what is even more important, a discretion as to making a provision at all. All authorities agree that it was never meant that the Court should re-write the will of a testator. Nor was it ever intended that the freedom of testamentary disposition should be so encroached upon that a testator's decisions expressed in his will have only a prima facie effect, the real dispositive power being vested in the Court.\\n        (emphasis added)\\n8. In Stott v Cook (1960) 33 ALJR 447, Taylor J observed, at 453-4:\\n        There is, in my opinion, no reason for thinking that justice is better served by the application of abstract principles of fairness than by acceptance of the judgment of a competent testator whose knowledge of the virtues and failings of the members of his family equips him for the responsibility of disposing of his estate is a far better measure than can be afforded to a Court by a few pages of affidavits sworn after his death and which only too frequently provide but an incomplete and shallow reflection of family relations and characteristics.\\n        (emphasis added)\\n9. In Hunter v Hunter (1987) 8 NSWLR 573 Kirby P said at 576:\\n        The [Testators Family Maintenance and Guardianship of Infants Act 1916] is written and is to be interpreted upon the assumption of freedom of testamentary disposition. That freedom is part of our law. It is widely regarded as an important civil right. Provisions made by a will shall therefore only be disturbed if adequate provision has not been made for a spouse or child who claims. The extent of the disturbance, if any, is discretionary. But because of respect for the competing principle of testamentary disposition, disturbance is limited to the extent only that is necessary to make adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life of an eligible claimant.\\n        (emphasis added)\\n10. Hallen J has re-stated the principle in a number of cases. See for example, Nagy v Marton [2014] NSWSC 540 at [128] – [134]; Kusmo v Kusmo [2014] NSWSC 1704 at [105] – [110]; Dodds v Dodds [2013] NSWSC 1933 at [107] – [111]; Bowditch v New South Wales Trustee and Guardian [2012] NSWSC 275 at [105] – [107] and Goodswell v Wellington [2011] NSWSC 1232 at [108]. In the last-mentioned case, Hallen AsJ (as he then was) said at [108]:\\n        Freedom of testamentary disposition remains a prominent feature of the Australian legal system. Its significance is both practical and symbolic and should not be underestimated.\\n11. In Kusmo v Kusmo His Honour said at [106]:\\n        The Court’s discretion is not untrammelled, or to be exercised according to idiosyncratic notions of what is thought to be fair, or in such a way as to transgress, unnecessarily, upon the deceased’s freedom of testation.\\n12. And finally in Wilcox v Wilcox [2012] NSWSC 1138 at [23], Madden-Smith v Madden [2012] NSWSC 146 at [30]-[34] and Brand v Brand [2015] NSWSC 52 at [21]-[23] I emphasised that the role of the court is not to ride roughshod over a testator’s intentions. See also Salmon v Osmond [2015] NSWCA 42 at [69] – [77].\\n13. The fact of the matter is that in this case, the testator, with the intimate knowledge that only he could have had of the nature and quality of his own unique relationship with the plaintiff, and with a father’s understanding of the trials and tribulations of his daughter, formed the view that (1) he did not want the plaintiff to have his house or to continue living in it and (2) that it would be a sufficient discharge of his moral obligation to her if she received a monetary sum sufficient for her to live in more modest accommodation for the rest of her life.\\n14. Who am I to override such an apparently rational and reasonable approach? There are no circumstances in this case that warrant the making of a family provision order. In particular, there is no justification for concluding that the provision made for the plaintiff in the testator’s will was not adequate for her proper maintenance in life. This is especially so having regard to the size of the estate and the needs of the testator’s daughter. I have set out the detailed facts in the following paragraphs.\\n\\n\\nThe Relationship between Plaintiff and Testator\\n15. When the plaintiff met the testator, she was residing at 28 Elizabeth Street, Paddington where she rented two rooms. One room was used as a bedroom and the other as her office. The testator was living in Greenwich. The plaintiff had no dependents. She continued to rent the Paddington premises and two rooms for the next 7 years and then rented one room for the next 20 years. She ceased the rental only recently after the testator’s death.\\n16. In about late 1988 the plaintiff moved into the testator’s then home in Balmain. From around 1996 the testator received a part-pension and subsequently a full pension. In 1997 he purchased the Lilyfield Property for $420,000, using his own funds to purchase, improve and repair it. The plaintiff moved to the Lilyfield Property with the testator and has since continued to reside there free of any rent or occupation fee.\\n17. In 1997 the plaintiff was a purchaser of a property in Buderim, Queensland. The purchase price was $160,000. She is now the sole registered proprietor. The plaintiff says that she intends to rent the property to her nephew at $100 per week. He pays for water, gas, electricity, pool, garden and septic tank maintenance. It had not previously been rented.\\n18. Throughout their relationship the plaintiff and the testator each maintained their own separate financial arrangements. The plaintiff held, and continues to hold, 8 separate bank accounts in her own name. The testator held one bank account in his own name. There was no sharing. Each paid their personal expenses from his or her own accounts. Each paid separately for – the costs of their respective properties and the maintenance and insurance of them; their individual private health insurance (and not insurance as a couple); the costs of purchasing and running their respective motor vehicles; and their separate clothing and entertainment expenses. Each took their vacations separately both overseas and within Australia, save on two occasions. In 2000 the testator and the plaintiff travelled to Buderim and in 2009 they went to New Zealand.\\n19. The plaintiff’s will executed on 17 February 2008 did not provide for the testator. It left her estate to her three sisters and her nephew in equal shares. I doubt that the plaintiff provided as much care and assistance to the testator as she suggested. She herself gave evidence that during 2013 the testator was regularly out and about driving alone. He drove himself to local medical appointments, his catheter change group and to the COPD group at Balmain Hospital twice each week. He even drove the plaintiff to the airport on 22 September 2013 on one of a number of occasions when she left him alone while she visited her property at Buderim.\\n\\n\\nThe Plaintiff’s Financial Circumstances\\n20. The plaintiff is now 65 years of age and remains in full employment as a social worker. She hopes to retire in a few years time. She currently has approximately $45,000 in cash at bank, most of which she inherited from her late father. Her property at Buderim has an estimated value of $370,000 to $425,000. The balance owing on the mortgage on the property is approximately $172,000. Her updated summary of assets and liabilities reveals assets of between $690,727 and $710,727 including superannuation of $233,016.99. Her liabilities are said to be $146,632.25. In addition, the value of her one third entitlement pursuant to the will of the testator is approximately $400,000. And she continues to earn $95,050 per annum. She will accrue further superannuation. Her superannuation is currently available to her in part through the ‘transition to retirement’ scheme under the taxation legislation. She has accrued 5 weeks extended paid leave.\\n21. I should add that the plaintiff’s father died in 2008 and that she received an initial payment of $155,000 from his estate. In 2013 she received a further $20,000 and in 2015 she received a further $4,320, making a total to date of $179,320.\\n\\n\\nBrita’s Financial Circumstances\\n22. Brita Benjamin is the only child of the testator. Her financial position is and has been for many years unstable and insecure. Her father’s desire to make provision for her as best he can, without ignoring the plaintiff, is wholly understandable. Brita is 53 years of age and works irregularly in various jobs including at Lifeline, as a stills photographer, as a make-up artist and sometimes as a cleaner. Her taxable income was $1,981 in 2011, $5,776 in 2012, nil in 2013 and $13,728 in 2014. She has been married to James Benjamin for the past 26 years. They have two daughters aged 25 and 23 who no longer reside with them. Brita and James currently live in a small flat underneath the home of Brita’s mother at Whale Beach. As at April 2014 the combined assets of Brita and James comprised a share portfolio, cash at bank and superannuation, with a total value of $161,603.88.\\n23. James is also aged 53 and currently works two days each week in a friend’s business and earns $25 per hour. He is hopeful that the business will succeed and expand. His track record does not however provide grounds for optimism. His taxable income was $8,468 in 2010, $7,744 in 2011, $5,776 in 2012 and $338 in 2013. From November 2013 and until June 2014, he received an unemployment benefit of $426.55 per fortnight.\\n24. Brita and James are also the shareholders of a company called J & B Benjamin Holdings Pty Ltd, which was registered in 1991. The company has run at a loss for most of its recent existence. Its accumulated losses were $74,909 in 2009, $71,400 in 2010, $7,416 in 2011, $125,042 in 2012 and $131,480 in 2013. Although the cross examination of Brita and James sought to establish that they were relatively financially comfortable, I am quite satisfied that their situation is as difficult as they both explained. I accept that the company structure assists them to some extent and no doubt operates to minimise their taxable incomes. But each was an impressive witness whose evidence I accept.\\n25. It is not necessary to provide a detailed historical account of the financial misfortunes of Brita and James. What matters more is their current situation. It is sufficient to say that financial hardship descended on them like a cloud in 1995 when James was retrenched from his position at NatWest Markets. He was unemployed for the following 13 months, as a result of which the family relocated to Robertson and later to nearby Mount Murray. The testator lent them $90,000 and James requalified as a teacher at Wollongong University, but does not appear to have made a success of it. James and Brita repaid $20,000 and possibly $40,000 of the $90,000 loan. In 2010 the testator extinguished the debt.\\n26. I accept James’ evidence that he had a manic episode in 2004 and was diagnosed as being bi-polar. Although the plaintiff’s counsel complained of the absence of formal medical corroboration, I do not doubt what he said. The more significant point however, is that James has not worked seriously or effectively in the finance industry since that time. In 2011, after their children finished school, and with some of the net proceeds of the sale of the Mount Murray property, Brita and James travelled overseas for a lengthy period. They spent approximately $110,000. After their return to Australia, they moved into Brita’s mother’s property at Whale Beach. And in 2012 they entered into a contract with Brita’s mother and her partner for $84,403 to build a flat underneath the property in which they could reside. This arrangement has allowed them to live rent free but provides no security of tenure. I should point out that there was no evidence of the age, health or testamentary intention of Brita’s mother but I have taken into account the prospect that Brita may one day be her mother’s beneficiary.\\n\\n\\nAdequate and Proper Provision\\n27. An applicant will only be entitled to provision if the court is satisfied that they are an ‘eligible person’ for the purposes of the Act and the deceased has failed in his or her moral duty. In Singer v Berghouse (1994) 181 CLR 201 and Vigolo v Bostin (2005) 221 CLR 191 the High Court said that courts hearing family provision cases should conduct a two-stage inquiry. The first stage involves a determination of whether the provision, in the absence of intervention by the court, is ‘adequate’ for the proper maintenance, support, education or advancement in life of the plaintiff. The second stage requires the court to engage in a discretionary exercise to determine what provision ought to be made: See also Andrew v Andrew [2012] NSWCA 308 at [69]-[71] (per Barrett JA).\\n28. I recently said in Chandler v Coulson [2015] NSWSC 172:\\n        26 If the court finds that a deceased person has failed in his or her moral duty and makes an order that interferes with the testamentary disposition disclosed in the will, any such order should only satisfy the applicant’s basic needs, and not his or her wants or desires. In addition, the order must not unfairly prejudice the other named beneficiaries of the deceased’s will.\\n        (emphasis added)\\n29. It may also be helpful to repeat what I said in Brand v Brand [2015] NSWSC 52:\\n        26 What is proper turns on whether a wise and just testator, aware of all the circumstances, would have thought it his or her moral duty to do more: Vigolo v Bostin (supra) at [15] – [22]; Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co (Ltd) [1983] AC 463 at 479; Goodsell v Wellington (supra) at [56] – [72]; Madden-Smith v Madden (supra) at [36]. I gratefully adopt the following statement in Verzar v Verzar [2014] NSWCA 45 at [39]:\\n                    Whether [adequate] provision has been made requires an assessment of the applicant’s financial position, the size and nature of the deceased’s estate, the relationships between the applicant and the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon his or her bounty and the circumstances and needs of those other persons: see Tobin v Ezekiel [2012] NSWCA 285; 83 NSWLR 75 at [70] and McCosker v McCosker [1957] HCA 82; 97 CLR 566 at 571-572; Singer v Berghouse [1994] HCA 40; 181 CLR 201 at 210; and Vigolo v Bostin [2005] HCA 11; 221 CLR 191 at [16], [75], [112]. Such an assessment is necessary because of the inter-relation between ‘adequate provision’ and ‘proper maintenance’. Whilst the inquiry as to what is ‘adequate’ directs particular attention to the needs of the applicant, what is ‘proper’ requires regard to all the circumstances of the case, and in particular the size and nature of the estate and the needs of the other beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries.\\n        27 The determination of what is adequate provision for a plaintiff’s proper maintenance, support and advancement in life requires consideration of the relativities. It also involves an evaluative judgment having regard to a plaintiff’s station in life and the standard of living he or she is entitled to expect: Madden-Smith v Madden (supra) at [36].\\n        28 Sections 59(2) and 60(1)(b) of the Act are analogous to the second stage of the approach enunciated by the High Court. They provide that the court may make such order for provision out of the estate of the deceased person as it thinks ought to be made for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life of the plaintiff, having regard to the facts known to the court at the time the order is made. This is an evaluative judgment which arises from the word ‘ought’ and requires examination of the applicant’s needs: Gwenda Jane Toth v Ronda Sedelia Graham [2014] NSWSC 393 at [10(8)].\\n\\n\\nSection 60(2) Factors\\n30. Section 60(2) of the Act sets out the matters that may be considered by the court in determining whether to make a family provision order. Those matters include the following that are relevant to this case:\\n             1. any family or other relationship between the applicant and the deceased person, including the nature and duration of the relationship;\\n             2. the nature and extent of any obligations or responsibilities owed by the deceased person to the applicant, to any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or to any beneficiary of the deceased person’s estate;\\n             3. the nature and extent of the deceased person’s estate (including any property that is, or could be, designated as notional estate of the deceased person) and of any liabilities or charges to which the estate is subject, as in existence when the application is being considered;\\n             4. the financial resources (including earning capacity) and financial needs, both present and future, of the applicant, of any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or of any beneficiary of the deceased person’s estate;\\n             5. the age of the applicant when the application is being considered;\\n             6. any provision made for the applicant by the deceased person, either during the deceased person’s lifetime or made from the deceased person’s estate;\\n             7. any evidence of the testamentary intentions of the deceased person, including evidence of statements made by the deceased person;\\n             8. whether the applicant was being maintained, either wholly or partly, by the deceased person before the deceased person’s death and, if the Court considers it relevant, the extent to which and the basis on which the deceased person did so.\\n31. In his analysis of Section 60(2) in Gwenda Jane Toth v Ronda Sedelia Graham [2014] NSWSC 393, Kunc J said at [10(11)], and I gratefully adopt:\\n        (11) Section 60(2)(p) confirms the breadth of matters the Court can take into account. Once enlivened, the Discretion is expressly fettered only by the requirement in s 59(2) that if an order is made, it must be such order ‘as the Court thinks ought to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person, having regard to the facts known to the Court at the time the order is made’. The Discretion is otherwise unconfined, which means that in answering question (9) the Court is otherwise constrained only by the need to act judicially, that is to say ‘not arbitrarily, capriciously or so as to frustrate the legislative intent’: Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at [22] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ. The Court must act rationally and exercise the Discretion for the purpose for which it was conferred.\\n\\n\\nAppropriate Order\\n32. Applying these principles, and having regard to each of the Section 60 factors that I have mentioned, I am satisfied that the manner in which the testator divided his estate was carefully considered and appropriate. It was adequate for her proper maintenance in all the circumstances. He made two wills, each of which reflected his appreciation of the competing demands of his daughter and the plaintiff, and his assessment of what he thought was a reasonable response to those demands. He recognised that he had a moral obligation to both his daughter and the plaintiff but concluded that his daughter and her husband had a greater need for financial assistance than the plaintiff.\\n33. The testamentary disposition that the testator prescribed was soundly based. It is supported by the facts and not undermined by the financial circumstances of Brita and the plaintiff that were revealed in the evidence. The totality of the evidentiary picture supports the wisdom and justice of the testator’s apportionment. I can see no reason to depart from it. The plaintiff’s affidavits, inevitably self-serving, and sworn after the death of the testator, do not persuade me otherwise\\n34. As I have observed, the plaintiff is financially secure and has sufficient funds to live a comfortable and fulfilling life after the Lilyfield property is sold. She is also in reasonable health and has the capacity to continue working for at least a few years. After she receives her share of the testator’s estate she will have assets of in excess of $1 million for her living and personal expenses. She will have to adjust to smaller accommodation, which on the evidence she will be able to afford, or rent. According to the evidence, the market value of a one bedroom apartment in the Lilyfield area is between $450,000 and $600,000. And she will need to live a more modest existence. This is a reality for many widows, let alone persons such as the plaintiff, whose relationship with the testator was more equivocal and uncertain, despite its longevity, than that of a conventional wife. Although the context was different, the following remark by Hallen J in Nagy v Marton at [252] is apposite:\\n        If the plaintiff wishes to remain living in Sydney, whether permanently or at different times, the plaintiff should choose a one-bedroom home unit which best suits her needs.\\n\\n\\nOrders\\n35.

The plaintiff claims a family provision order out of the estate of the late Susan Carla Malins pursuant to section 59 of the Succession Act 2006. He contends that he is eligible to make a claim because he was in a de facto relationship with the deceased at the time of her death. Although the plaintiff’s eligibility was disputed by the defendant, by the end of the hearing it was clear that his evidence was reliable and that I should accept his contention that he and the deceased were living in a de facto marriage at the time of her death. The only issue to be determined therefore is whether by her will the deceased made adequate provision for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the plaintiff.\\n2. For the reasons that follow I am satisfied that a wise and just testatrix in the position of the deceased would have made some provision for the plaintiff in her will. Such provision would have reflected the care and support that he provided to her during the later years of her life, and particularly when she was in ill health.\\n\\n\\nThe Will\\n3. The deceased made her last will on 2 October 2007 and died on 30 November 2013 aged 57. Probate was granted on 19 February 2014. By her will, she divided her estate between her ex-husband, friends, charities and significantly, the plaintiff’s son. The deceased made no provision for the plaintiff in her will.\\n4. Her estate was left to be distributed as follows:\\n             1. $2,000.00 to Geoffrey Lansbury and Marjory Lansbury, in equal shares;\\n             2. Wedding album to Harold Anthony Malins (the deceased’s ex-husband);\\n             3. Two-elevenths of the residue to Wendy Joy Carey;\\n             4. One-eleventh of the residue to Glenn Anthony Virgona and Marie Virgona in equal shares;\\n             5. One-eleventh of the residue to Timothy Don Chandler (the son of the plaintiff);\\n             6. One-eleventh of the residue to Gregory Wayne Hunter;\\n             7. Two-elevenths of the residue to Brian Coulson (the defendant and executor of the will) and Janette Inez Coulson in equal shares;\\n             8. One-eleventh of the residue to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals;\\n             9. One-eleventh of the residue to Guide Dogs Victoria; and\\n            10. Two-elevenths of the residue to the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria.\\n5. The parties agreed that the breakdown of assets of the deceased’s estate is as follows:\\n             1. A three bedroom property at 32 Ballina Street, Pottsville NSW - $510,000.00\\n             2. Bank account and trust account - $309,339.80\\n             3. TOTAL - $900,339.80\\n6. After the costs of these proceedings and expenses associated with selling the Pottsville property are deducted the net distributable estate will be approximately $837,000.\\n\\n\\nThe Plaintiff’s Circumstances\\n7. The plaintiff is 60 years of age and unemployed. He is the recipient of a disability pension of $375.85 per week, has no superannuation and few assets. He suffers from back and neck pain, which inhibits his ability to work. He is the father of three adult children and has two grandchildren. The plaintiff’s son, Timothy, is married and his wife is expecting their second child. All of the plaintiff’s children have modest incomes and are unable to support him financially.\\n8. The plaintiff resides rent-free in the deceased’s property at Pottsville. She purchased it in late 2011. Given the plaintiff’s situation in life, and his needs, he submits that adequate and appropriate provision requires the Pottsville property to be transferred to him, or in the alternative that he should receive an award of up to $531,000. For the reasons that follow, I have reached the view, that he should receive an award of $400,000.\\n\\n\\nThe Plaintiff and deceased’s relationship\\n9. The plaintiff and deceased met in about 1999 in Nerang, Queensland. They soon commenced a relationship and began residing together at a property which the plaintiff rented at Nerang. The deceased was unemployed but was receiving a disability support pension. She suffered from epilepsy. She had also been alcohol dependent since the death of her father in the mid-1990s, had a generalised anxiety disorder and a history of depression. When he met the deceased, the plaintiff worked fulltime as a concreter. While they lived at the property at Nerang, the plaintiff supported the deceased by providing her with transport and by paying for items such as food, alcohol and utilities.\\n10. In or about early 2000 the deceased received a significant sum of money from a divorce settlement with her ex-husband. The deceased used the proceeds to purchase a property for $150,000 at Currumbin Waters, Queensland. The deceased, the plaintiff and Timothy, who was then 13 or 14 years old, then moved into the property. During their time at the Currumbin Waters property the plaintiff paid for household expenses and the deceased paid the rates and insurance.\\n11. In 2002 the deceased sold the property at Currumbin Waters for $290,000 and purchased a unit at Palm Beach, Queensland, for $225,000. The deceased, the plaintiff and Timothy resided at the Palm Beach unit until 2006. Timothy then moved out to live with friends. Sometime in 2006 the deceased’s alcohol consumption increased significantly – to the point that she was drinking a bottle of vodka every day. The plaintiff says that this strained their relationship. At the request of the plaintiff, the deceased checked into an alcohol rehabilitation clinic, where she stayed for approximately four weeks. Despite a short period of sobriety the plaintiff soon relapsed and started drinking again. In or about late 2006 or early 2007 the plaintiff and the deceased separated and the plaintiff moved out of the Palm Beach unit, living for a short period in his ex-partner’s garage. He then re-located to Forster in New South Wales. After moving to Forster the plaintiff cashed in his superannuation for approximately $14,000 and unsuccessfully used the funds to establish a concreting business.\\n12. Shortly after the plaintiff moved to Forster, the defendant, who was a family friend, received a telephone call from the deceased’s mother who was distressed because she could not locate her daughter. The defendant ascertained that the deceased had been admitted to the Logan Hospital in Queensland. The defendant promptly flew to Queensland and made arrangements for the deceased to move to Mentone, a suburb on the outskirts of Melbourne, to live with her mother. The Palm Beach unit was then sold. On 4 October 2007 the deceased appointed the defendant and his wife as her Powers of Attorney. This was two days after making her will, leaving nothing to the plaintiff.\\n13. In or around the middle of 2008, the plaintiff and the deceased reconciled and the deceased moved from Mentone to live with the plaintiff at Forster. After approximately 6 months, the deceased moved back to Mentone to be with her mother who had fallen ill. Shortly after the departure of the deceased, the plaintiff suffered a prolapsed disc injury while working. In early 2009 the plaintiff started receiving a disability support pension.\\n14. On 23 May 2009 the deceased’s mother died. The deceased inherited the entirety of her mother’s estate, which comprised her home in Mentone valued at $575,000, cash to the value of $257,807, and shares valued at $2,016. After her mother’s death, the deceased’s alcohol consumption increased and her health suffered. On 29 December 2009 she was admitted to the Monash Medical Centre because of acute pancreatitis. On 18 January 2010 the deceased undertook a neuropsychological assessment. Its results indicated that she lacked sufficient cognitive capacity to make lifestyle decisions and would benefit from living in a supported residential care environment.\\n15. In January and February 2010 the deceased was again hospitalised at Monash Medical Centre and was subsequently admitted to a facility called Sunnyhurst Gardens Aged Care. On 22 February 2010 the defendant and another family friend, Wendy Carey, were appointed as administrators of the deceased’s estate and her legal guardians by the Victorian Civil and Administration Tribunal (VCAT). During the deceased’s time at Sunnyhurst, the plaintiff and the deceased were in frequent telephone contact and he visited her on more than one occasion. While at the facility the deceased instructed McDonald Slater and Lay, a law firm in Mentone, to make an application to have the orders made by VCAT on 22 February 2010 revoked. On 25 August 2010 VCAT appointed Lauren Smith, a solicitor at McDonald Slater and Lay, as the deceased’s administrator and the Office of the Public Advocate as the deceased’s limited guardian. In November 2010 the plaintiff was discharged from Sunnyhurst and returned home to Mentone. By this time the plaintiff had left Forster permanently and was residing alone at the Mentone property for approximately three to four weeks. Once the deceased returned home she and the plaintiff resumed cohabitating and he became her carer.\\n16. In late 2010 the plaintiff started receiving a carers pension from the Department of Human Services. In order to receive a greater payment per fortnight, the plaintiff declared that he was single rather than a member of a couple. The deceased was still receiving a disability support pension on the basis that she was single. These declarations were not a true reflection of the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased. Indeed about the time the plaintiff started receiving the carers pension, he and the deceased became engaged.\\n17. On 29 July 2011 the order appointing Lauren Smith as administrator was revoked due to a dispute over her fees, and VCAT re-appointed the defendant as administrator of the deceased’s estate. From 29 July 2011 the defendant commenced to pay the deceased from her own funds the sum of $400 per week. In December 2011 that amount was reduced to $300 per week. In the same month the Mentone property was sold for $575,000. With these funds the deceased instructed the defendant to purchase a property at Pottsville in northern New South Wales for $515,000. In February 2012 the plaintiff and the deceased began residing together at the Pottsville property, where they lived until her death in November 2013.\\n18. After their re-location to Pottsville the plaintiff and the deceased lived as a couple and were happy in each other’s company notwithstanding the deceased’s deteriorating health. They established a social network and were members of the Pottsville Pirates Bowling Club. A condolence card signed by members of the club following the death of the deceased referred to her as the plaintiff’s ‘wife’.\\n19. Although seemingly happy, the deceased’s alcohol consumption was still substantial and her admissions to medical clinics frequent. On 17 March 2013 a CT scan of the deceased revealed that she had a nerve root impingement. In July 2013 the deceased was admitted to the Currumbin Clinic in southern Queensland for her alcohol dependence disorder. She was then transferred to John Flynn Hospital, also in Queensland. In a letter to the Guardianship Tribunal on 31 August 2013, Dr King of the John Flynn Hospital stated that a metastatic tumour had been diagnosed on the plaintiff’s hip and an MRI scan showed frontal atrophy and small vessel disease. Dr King also suspected that the plaintiff could have dementia and subacute delirium. Although the plaintiff underwent surgery to remove the tumour in September 2013, which was apparently a success, she died at John Flynn Hospital in November 2013 as a result of her other various (and numerous) health issues.\\n20. The plaintiff was the only person close to the deceased who was present at the hospital when she died. In fact, when she died, he was the only person with whom she had a close emotional relationship. Although at times tempestuous, their relationship was one of mutual dependence. In the circumstances, including the shared history and the plaintiff’s financial position, I have concluded that the deceased had a moral duty to provide for him by her will.\\n\\n\\nFreedom of testamentary disposition\\n21. I should note however that in family provision cases, the starting point is that the court should respect the deceased’s freedom of testamentary disposition: Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales (1961-62) 107 CLR 9; Vigolo v Bostin (2005) 221 CLR 191 at [10]; Goodswell v Wellington [2011] NSWSC 1232 at [108]. The re-writing of a deceased’s will is discouraged, and the court should only interfere with the testamentary disposition of the deceased when it is satisfied that the deceased has failed in his or her moral duty to the claimant and that the statutory criteria for making an award are met.\\n22. In Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith, Dixon CJ explained, at 19:\\n        The Court is given not only a discretion as to the nature and amount of the provision it directs but, what is even more important, a discretion as to making a provision at all. All authorities agree that it was never meant that the Court should re-write the will of a testator. Nor was it ever intended that the freedom of testamentary disposition should be so encroached upon that a testator's decisions expressed in his will have only a prima facie effect, the real dispositive power being vested in the Court.\\n23. Furthermore, in the context of an earlier similar regulation, Kirby P said at 576 in Hunter v Hunter (1987) 8 NSWLR 573:\\n        The [Testators Family Maintenance and Guardianship of Infants Act 1916] is written and is to be interpreted upon the assumption of freedom of testamentary disposition. That freedom is part of our law. It is widely regarded as an important civil right. Provisions made by a will shall therefore only be disturbed if adequate provision has not been made for a spouse or child who claims. The extent of the disturbance, if any, is discretionary. But because of respect for the competing principle of testamentary disposition, disturbance is limited to the extent only that is necessary to make adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life of an eligible claimant.\\n        (emphasis added)\\n24. As I said in Madden-Smith v Madden [2012] NSWSC 146:\\n        32 There are sound practical reasons for not encroaching too readily on the testator’s freedom of testamentary disposition and especially not in accordance with abstract concepts such as fairness or the misguided notion that there should be equality between the children of the testator. In Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales (supra) at 20 Dixon CJ articulated the unique difficulty which these cases present with the following memorable apophthegm:\\n                    The difficulty is that the Court itself can never be certain that it knows all the circumstances. More often than not, one may be sure that the Court knows few of them. Experience of forensic contests should confirm the truth of the common saying that one story is good until another is told, but a testator is dead and cannot tell his.\\n        33 To similar effect were some observations of Taylor J in Stott v Cook (1960) 33 ALJR 447 at 453-4, who explained that the reason why a court does not have a mandate to rework a will according to its own notions of fairness, is because such an approach would serve justice no better than:\\n                    …acceptance of the judgment of a competent testator whose knowledge of the virtues and failings of the members of his family equips him for the responsibility of disposing of his estate in far better measure than can be afforded to a Court by a few pages of affidavits sworn after his death and which only too frequently provide but an incomplete and shallow reflection of family relations and characteristics.\\n                    (emphasis added)\\n25. And in Wilcox v Wilcox [2012] NSWSC 1138:\\n        23 I reiterate that the process that must be undertaken in a case such as this is an evaluative process. It necessarily involves consideration of the relativities. That process is driven by the statutory criteria. The court does not simply ride roughshod over the testator’s intentions. I have no mandate to re-write the will with a broad brush.\\n26. If the court finds that a deceased person has failed in his or her moral duty and makes an order that interferes with the testamentary disposition disclosed in the will, any such order should only satisfy the applicant’s basic needs, and not his or her wants or desires. In addition, the order must not unfairly prejudice the other named beneficiaries of the deceased’s will. In making a family provision order, the court aims as far possible, to balance the preservation of the testamentary intention of the deceased, while endeavouring to satisfy the claimant’s entitlement to an ‘adequate’ provision, without unfairly prejudicing the position of other beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\nAdequate and Proper Provision\\n27. Once it has been determined that a claimant for a family provision order is an eligible person, the task of the court is to determine whether or not adequate provision for the proper maintenance, support, education or advancement in life of the claimant has been made by the will of a deceased: Section 59(1)I of the Act.\\n28. The proper approach in determining whether a family provision order should be made is to conduct the two-stage inquiry explained by the High Court in Singer v Berghouse (1994) 181 CLR 201 and Vigolo v Bostin (2005) 221 CLR 191. The first stage involves a determination of whether the provision, in the absence of intervention by the court, is ‘adequate’ for the ‘proper’ maintenance, support, education or advancement in life of the plaintiff. The second stage requires the court to engage in a discretionary exercise to determine what provision ought to be made: See also Andrew v Andrew [2012] NSWCA 308 at [69]-[71] (per Barrett JA).\\n29. I repeat what I said in Brand v Brand [2015] NSWSC 52:\\n        26 The term ‘adequate’ and especially the term ‘proper’, are value laden concepts. They cannot always be neatly divided but in general terms, the former is concerned with quantum while the latter directs attention to what is appropriate in all the circumstances: Madden-Smith v Madden (supra) at [36]; Alexander v Jansson [2010] NSWCA 176. In Goodman v Windeyer (1980) 144 CLR 490, Gibbs J at 502 stated:\\n                    The words ‘adequate’ and ‘proper’ are always relative. There are no fixed standards, and the court is left to form opinions upon the basis of its own general knowledge and experience of current social conditions and standards.\\n        27 What is proper turns on whether a wise and just testator, aware of all the circumstances, would have thought it his or her moral duty to do more: Vigolo v Bostin (supra) at [15] – [22]; Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co (Ltd) [1983] AC 463 at 479; Goodsell v Wellington (supra) at [56] – [72]; Madden-Smith v Madden (supra) at [36]. I gratefully adopt the following statement in Verzar v Verzar [2014] NSWCA 45 at [39]:\\n                    Whether [adequate] provision has been made requires an assessment of the applicant’s financial position, the size and nature of the deceased’s estate, the relationships between the applicant and the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon his or her bounty and the circumstances and needs of those other persons: see Tobin v Ezekiel [2012] NSWCA 285; 83 NSWLR 75 at [70] and McCosker v McCosker [1957] HCA 82; 97 CLR 566 at 571-572; Singer v Berghouse [1994] HCA 40; 181 CLR 201 at 210; and Vigolo v Bostin [2005] HCA 11; 221 CLR 191 at [16], [75], [112]. Such an assessment is necessary because of the inter-relation between ‘adequate provision’ and ‘proper maintenance’. Whilst the inquiry as to what is ‘adequate’ directs particular attention to the needs of the applicant, what is ‘proper’ requires regard to all the circumstances of the case, and in particular the size and nature of the estate and the needs of the other beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries.\\n        28 The determination of what is adequate provision for a plaintiff’s proper maintenance, support and advancement in life requires consideration of the relativities. It also involves an evaluative judgment having regard to a plaintiff’s station in life and the standard of living he or she is entitled to expect: Madden-Smith v Madden (supra) at [36].\\n        29 Sections 59(2) and 60(1)(b) of the Act are analogous to the second stage of the approach enunciated by the High Court. They provide that the court may make such order for provision out of the estate of the deceased person as it thinks ought to be made for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life of the plaintiff, having regard to the facts known to the court at the time the order is made. This is an evaluative judgment which arises from the word ‘ought’ and requires examination of the applicant’s needs: Gwenda Jane Toth v Ronda Sedelia Graham [2014] NSWSC 393 at [10(8)].\\n\\n\\nSection 60(2) Factors\\n30. Section 60(2) of the Act sets out the matters that may be considered by the court in determining whether to make a family provision order. Matters relevant to this case include:\\n             1. Any family or other relationship between the applicant and the deceased person, including the nature and duration of the relationship.\\n             2. The nature and extent of any obligations or responsibilities owed by the deceased person to the applicant, to any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or to any beneficiary of the deceased person’s estate.\\n             3. The nature and extent of the deceased person’s estate (including any property that is, or could be, designated as notional estate of the deceased person) and of any liabilities or charges to which the estate is subject, as in existence when the application is being considered.\\n             4. The financial resources (including earning capacity) and financial needs, both present and future, of the applicant, of any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or of any beneficiary of the deceased person’s estate.\\n             5. Any physical, intellectual or mental disability of the applicant, any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or any beneficiary of the deceased person’s estate that is in existence when the application is being considered or that may reasonably be anticipated.\\n             6. The age of the applicant when the application is being considered.\\n             7. Any contribution (whether financial or otherwise) by the applicant to the acquisition, conservation and improvement of the estate of the deceased person or to the welfare of the deceased person or the deceased person’s family, whether made before or after the deceased person’s death, for which adequate consideration (not including any pension or other benefit) was not received, by the applicant.\\n             8. Any provision made for the applicant by the deceased person, either during the deceased person’s lifetime or made from the deceased person’s estate.\\n             9. Whether the applicant was being maintained, either wholly or partly, by the deceased person before the deceased person’s death and, if the Court considers it relevant, the extent to which and the basis on which the deceased person did so.\\n            10. Whether any other person is liable to support the applicant.\\n            11. The character and conduct of the applicant before and after the date of the death of the deceased person.\\n31. In his analysis of s 60(2) in Toth v Graham Kunc J said said at [10(11)], and I gratefully adopt:\\n        (11) Section 60(2)(p) confirms the breadth of matters the Court can take into account . Once enlivened, the Discretion is expressly fettered only by the requirement in s 59(2) that if an order is made, it must be such order ‘as the Court thinks ought to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person, having regard to the facts known to the Court at the time the order is made’. The Discretion is otherwise unconfined, which means that in answer question (9) the Court is otherwise constrained only by the need to act judicially, that is to say ‘not arbitrarily, capriciously or so as to frustrate the legislative intent’: Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at [22] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ. The Court must act rationally and exercise the Discretion for the purpose for which it was conferred.\\n\\n\\nAppropriate Order\\n32. As I have already made clear, the facts of this case satisfy me that the deceased had a moral obligation to provide for the plaintiff by her will. The plaintiff and deceased were in a de facto relationship between 2000 and 2006, and again, at least from late 2010 until her death. Although they were, for the most part, living separately between 2006 and 2010, they were still in contact during this period, and to varying degrees, dependent on each other. Each was, in my view, a prominent figure in the life of the other.\\n33. The plaintiff met the deceased at a difficult stage of her life and supported her emotionally for a number of years. For the duration of their relationship, the deceased was a sick woman due to her chronic alcohol abuse. Her medical history was extensive. Before her death she was suffering from, or had suffered from, illnesses that included epilepsy, type II diabetes, mellitus, hypothryoidism, GORD, hepatic enephalopathy, delerium, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. She was on numerous medications during her relationship with the plaintiff who took it upon himself to monitor her medical condition and assist with her medication.\\n34. The plaintiff supported the deceased financially when their relationship was in its infancy. At all times he provided transport for her. Throughout the course of their relationship, he assumed the primary responsibility for the performance of tasks such as grocery shopping, cleaning, gardening and cooking. And he performed general maintenance work on all the properties that they lived in, and particularly the Mentone property before it was sold.\\n35. When the deceased’s alcoholism became so bad that she was again admitted to a rehabilitation facility in 2010, the plaintiff was one of a few persons who visited and cared for her. Upon her release from the facility, the plaintiff became her carer. He assumed responsibilities such as bathing the deceased, assisting her going to the toilet, feeding her and driving her up to 40 kilometres to medical appointments. It is reasonable to infer that, without the support of the plaintiff that the deceased would not have lived as long as she did. The burden of caring for a loved one during a period of illness should not be underestimated.\\n36. The plaintiff is also clearly in need. His age and his back and neck injuries inhibit his capacity to generate an income. He has no superannuation and aside from a car and some personal belongings, valued at approximately $2,500, has no assets. He has borrowed $6,500 from his mother and has been advanced $1,000 from Centrelink. His children are not affluent and cannot support him financially. If he is required to leave the Pottsville property, or provision is not provided from the deceased’s estate, he is likely to experience significant hardship for the duration of his life.\\n37. A relevant consideration however is that, except when he and the deceased lived at Nerang, and when he lived alone in Forster, he has lived rent-free in homes owned by the deceased. Another consideration is that most of the named beneficiaries in the will are not particularly wealthy. I should minimise the likelihood that they will suffer hardship by being deprived of a significant portion of their legacies. Nor do I wish to deprive, to any substantial degree, the named charities in the deceased’s will of the legacies to which they are prima facie entitled.\\n38. Conclusion\\n39. I therefore do not propose to make either of the orders sought by the plaintiff. A less generous provision will be adequate and appropriate. Although an order that the Pottsville property be transferred to the plaintiff would be an uncomplicated way of resolving these proceedings, it would be too generous in the circumstances. The plaintiff has no need for a three bedroom property such as the Pottsville property. At most he requires a two bedroom property so that he can reside permanently in one bedroom and use another as a spare room in the event that his children and grandchildren visit. Similarly, an award of $531,000 would also be too generous to the plaintiff. This is more than enough to satisfy his basic needs and, in my opinion, would unjustly deprive the other beneficiaries of a significant portion of their legacies under the will.\\n40. I have reached the conclusion that an award of $400,000 to the plaintiff is appropriate and adequate. This will enable him to purchase a two bedroom unit in the Pottsville area, which I was informed would cost between $240,000 and $275,000, and will leave him with a substantial surplus of funds for his expenses. The burden of the award should be borne evenly and proportionately by the eight beneficiaries of the deceased’s will who are the recipients of the eleventh share of her estate. The respective one-eleventh shares would be reduced pro-rata to meet the award.\\n\\n\\nOrders and Costs\\n41. For those reasons, I make orders as follows:\\n         1. The costs of the plaintiff should be paid out of the estate on the ordinary basis.\\n         2. The costs of the defendant should be paid out of the estate on an indemnity basis.\\n         3. The plaintiff should receive the sum of $400,000 out of the estate.\\n         4. The net balance of the estate remaining after the payment of the amounts in (1), (2) and (3) above, should be paid in accordance with the terms of the deceased’s will.\\nDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Dunn, Dunn Legal\\nFile Number(s):           2019/333391\\nPublication restriction:  No\\n\\n\\n\\nJudgment\\n1. The plaintiff, Ms Sharron Bryan brings an application for an order for interim provision out of the estate of her late father, Keith Alexander Beveridge (“the deceased”) under Succession Act 2006, s 62. The first defendant, the deceased’s executor, Ms Patricia Ellen Beveridge, who is the plaintiff’s mother, resists aspects of her daughter’s application.\\n2. The deceased’s last will gave the whole of his estate to the first defendant. It is not in issue that the market value of the deceased’s estate is presently of the order of $8 to $12 million and that property to the value of about $50 million, some of which is held by the second defendant, a corporate trustee of a discretionary trust controlled by the first defendant, is potentially available for designation as notional estate.\\n3. The evidence supports the conclusion that the plaintiff has limited financial resources, has been living in a state of financial uncertainty for some years since the deceased’s death, and is being treated by medical specialists for multiple myeloma.\\n4. By her Amended Notice of Motion dated 26 October 2021 (“the Motion”), the plaintiff seeks an order for interim provision from the deceased’s estate in the amount of $220,206.62 by 1 December 2021. The plaintiff says she proposes to apply this interim provision to meet medical expenses for treatment associated with her multiple myeloma which is due to commence in January 2022.\\n5. The Motion was heard on 1 November 2021 in the Equity Duty List. The defendants concede that some interim provision should be provided and they accept that the estate can provide $20,000 of that interim provision on or before 22 November 2021. The narrow dispute that remains between these parties is as to the timing of payment of the balance of the interim provision.\\n6. The plaintiff says she needs the bulk of the funding requested by 1 December 2021 to pay for her cancer treatment. The defendant says that the estate cannot pay the balance until 31 January 2022. In effect the contest is about whether the sum of $200,000 will be paid to the plaintiff at the beginning or at the end of the period of two months between 1 December 2021 and 31 January 2022. This point has occupied a disproportionate portion of the energy of these parties and their legal advisors in the last few days.\\n7. Mr K. Morrissey of counsel, instructed by Mr Goldberg of Turner Freeman Lawyers, appeared for the plaintiff. Mr C. Wilson of counsel instructed by Mr Dunn of Dunn Legal appeared for the defendant.\\n8. These reasons order the payment of the interim provision by 1 December 2021, and in default of that order grant to the plaintiff liberty to apply to seek orders to enforce the order for the payment of the balance against the estate.\\n\\n\\nApplicable Legal Principles\\n9. The applicable legal principles may be shortly stated. Succession Act, s 62 provides that the Court may make an interim family provision order before it has fully considered an application for a final family provision order, “if it is of the opinion that no less provision than that proposed in the interim order would be made in favour of the eligible person concerned in the final order”. That wording in substance appeared in the predecessor legislation, the Family Provision Act 1982, s 9(5) (“the FPA”). The current statutory jurisdiction to make interim orders was not available before the enactment of the FPA.\\n10. The decision of Young v Salkeld (1985) 4 NSWLR 375 (“Salkeld”) considered FPA, s 9(5). In Salkeld, the duties of the Court on such an application were summarised by Young J as described in this paragraph. The Court is to examine what evidentiary material is placed before it to assess from that material the probable outcome of the proceedings at final hearing. The Court is also required to consider, as at the date when the Court makes its final consideration of the matter, what the applicant’s and the estate’s circumstances are likely to be. When exercising this jurisdiction, the Court may make an interim order that it considers proper to make and it is not restricted to making provision for immediate maintenance. And it would ordinarily be proper to make an order that would give the eligible person only such a sum as would deal with the real needs of the applicant pending the hearing and then usually only on terms that the monies could be recovered if the applicant were to be unsuccessful.\\n11. Kunc J applied these principles when exercising Succession Act, s 62 jurisdiction in Roberts v Moses [2015] NSWSC 1504 (“Roberts”) and in Steiner v Strang [2017] NSWSC 132 (“Steiner”). In Roberts (at [13]) and Steiner (at [28]) Kunc J dealt with the scope of interim family provision orders. His Honour pointed out that a “family provision order” as the term is used in s 62 is no less a “family provision order”, than that term is defined in Succession Act, s 3. The definition of “the family provision order” in s 3 is “an order made by the Court under Chapter 3 in relation to the estate or the notional estate of the deceased person to provide from that estate for the maintenance education or advancement in life of an eligible person”. Kunc J observed in Roberts and Steiner that in the text of s 62, “family provision order” is only qualified by the word “interim”. Importantly for this case, Kunc J’s reasons in Roberts and Steiner would justify interim orders being made against notional estate. This issue has not been contested before me on this application as yet and at present orders will only be made against the first defendant.\\n12. Another important consequence of Kunc J’s reasons in Roberts and Steiner in this case is that, if required, the Court may be able to look to the statutory power conferred by Succession Act, s 66 to make consequential and ancillary orders “in addition to or as part of a family provision order”. Those consequential orders under Succession Act, s 66 include the securing of the due performance of an order under Part 3 of the Succession Act: s 66(1)(i).\\n13. The Court does not need to look to other sources of jurisdiction here. The Court has power to increase an existing legacy to make an interim distribution, such as in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by Probate and Administration Act 1898, s 84 or Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005, r 54.3(3). Here, the plaintiff received nothing under the deceased’s will and only Succession Act, s 62 jurisdiction is engaged.\\n\\n\\nAdditional Background and the Parties’ Submissions\\n14. Other background facts based in the evidence are relevant. The plaintiff’s claim at final hearing is for a family provision order of over $8 million. Its major components include medical treatment of over $1.5 million, superannuation of $2 million and school fees for the plaintiff’s children of $250,000. In addition, the plaintiff claims many incidental medical and other expenses.\\n15. The evidence of Mr Goldberg, the solicitor for the plaintiff, estimates that the real property in the estate may be valued between about $8 to $12 million and that the notional estate comprised largely of real property may have a value of at least $50 million. Mr Goldberg says that there are other unknown assets in the estate, including proceeds of loan accounts and cash at the bank. His affidavit of 1 November 2021 exhibits appraisals of five properties, including a commercial property in Parramatta said to have a market value of $35 million and a property in Dundas (“the Dundas property”), said to have a market value of $14.5 million. The commercial property in Parramatta is a 42-room motel with a liquor license, swimming pool and conference facility, which, according to the plaintiff, is enjoying high rates of occupancy. A substantial residential property in Chatswood is the major real property in the estate.\\n16. The order for interim provision the plaintiff seeks from the estate or the notional estate is the aggregate of various sums to the total of $220,206.62. These are made up as follows.\\n17. The plaintiff has personal liabilities in the sum of just over $15,000. She currently pays health insurance premiums of $565.85 per month. Part of her claim for interim family provision is to cover six months’ of health insurance premiums in the total sum of $3,394.10. Moreover, the plaintiff’s evidence is that she is without funds to pay her daughter, Jessika’s school fees for the next two terms and needs $6,500 to pay those. The plaintiff does not have a motor vehicle and says that she needs one and seeks $30,000 for a used Hyundai motor vehicle. Neither the plaintiff nor her husband have any spare cash and they seek an amount of $5,000 to assist her until the final hearing of the proceedings in order to cope with her ongoing general medical needs.\\n18. In addition to those needs, the plaintiff’s evidence is that she needs treatment with the anti-cancer drug, Daratumumab. The plaintiff’s evidence is that Daratumumab is now available in Australia but it requires private funding, although the other drugs used in combination with it are available via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (“PBS”). The defendants’ evidence is that Daratumumab is now available in the PBS. But the plaintiff’s personal eligibility for PBS benefits for Daratumumab is not established, so the proper inference from the plaintiff’s evidence is that she is still likely to have to pay for it.\\n19. The plaintiff’s evidence is that she needs this Daratumumab treatment now, and that the treatment plan would include eight doses received weekly, then eight doses given fortnightly for four months and which would then continue monthly. Her treatment needs to start in January 2022 and the total cost of her treatments would be $157,278. The plaintiff’s evidence is that she would be asked to pay for this sum for this treatment upfront in early December in 2021. In addition to these treatments, the plaintiff’s evidence is that she is likely to incur additional costs not covered by ordinary health insurance in the order of $2,780. The plaintiff’s claim for $220,206.62 is the sum of all those various amounts.\\n20. Title searches show that the Dundas property is unencumbered. Title searches also show that some of the defendants’ properties are mortgaged to the National Australia Bank, with whom it can be inferred the defendants have a banking relationship.\\n21. In the evidence filed in the proceedings to date, the first defendant has not put on evidence as to her assets or her need for capital, so as to indicate her competing need for the deceased’s testamentary bounty.\\n22. The first defendant’s evidence establishes that she is very unwell at present. She is undergoing intensive investigations for suspected cancer. The fact of those investigations and the probability of her needing to undergo surgery and for her to be placed under a general anaesthetic were reasons why the four-day hearing due to commence today, 8 November 2021 was vacated.\\n23. The first defendant gave instructions to solicitors that she would agree to provide the plaintiff with interim family provision of $220,000, but she expressed her concern that she did not have the capacity to pay that sum immediately. She expressed the view that she may need to sell a property, or to refinance, and that either way “that will take some time”. She said that if a property is to be sold, “I expect that the earliest that funds would be available from settlement would be in mid-January 2022”. Another issue in the proceedings was whether or not the plaintiff could remain at her present residence, a property owned by one of the defendants. The first defendant eliminated that issue by undertaking not to sell that property to raise the $220,000.\\n24. It is reasonably clear from this evidence, and from submissions made on behalf of the defendants, that counsel has only been able to obtain limited clear instructions from the first defendant. This is due both to her present medical condition and her concerns about the medical treatment that she may soon have to undertake.\\n25. The medical evidence conflicts as to whether the plaintiff needs the cancer treatment that underpins her claim for interim family provision. This rather unusual contest emerges in the following way. After conflicting medical evidence and uncertainty about the range of treatments available to the plaintiff both locally and internationally, the Court decided to appoint Professor Simon Harrison, an Honorary Clinical Professor at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Department of Oncology at Melbourne University as a Court expert to answer questions about a wide range of options both in Australia and overseas for the plaintiff’s future treatment.\\n26. Professor Harrison provided a comprehensive report answering some 77 detailed questions which has been the subject of submissions in these interlocutory proceedings. Mr Wilson, on behalf of the estate, submits with support from Professor Harrison’s report that it does not recommend therapies for the plaintiff, such as Car-T therapy as being any better than the treatment she has presently been receiving. It can be accepted Professor Harrison does not see any clear benefit of Car-T therapy for the plaintiff.\\n27. But in answer to several questions, Professor Harrison gives the opinion that Daratumumab is an available second line therapy for the plaintiff and that its cost is much the same as the plaintiff claims it to be. Whatever be the outcome of the medical evidence about Car-T therapy, Professor Harrison’s report does appear to support Daratumumab as a “second line” therapy for the plaintiff.\\n28. The defendants’ submissions focus on the lack of need for the plaintiff receiving Car-T treatment. But it seems clear from the evidence of Mr Goldberg and Professor Harrison that the interim provision is being sought, not for Car-T treatment, but for Daratumumab and Professor Harrison does not rule it out for the plaintiff.\\n29. The plaintiff’s treating oncologist, Dr Jane Freeman, has strongly and continuously recommended the commencement of Daratumumab-based therapy for the plaintiff in several medical reports that she has provided to the Court.\\n30. This medical evidence does not appear to be in as much conflict as the defendants sought to submit. But even if it were, context is important. This is an interlocutory hearing, not a final hearing. This is not the time for the Court to make a final determination of any conflicts between Professor Harrison’s evidence and Dr Freeman’s evidence, or that of any other medical specialist. The Court is very cautious about preferring the evidence of any expert over another before a full final hearing takes place.\\n31. The Court must make this decision based on the available evidence, which includes a recommendation by the plaintiff’s treating oncologist for the treatment for which the interim provision is required. The Court would be loath to deny the plaintiff interim provision against the recommendation of her treating oncologist, on the basis that it might be in conflict with the evidence of a Court-appointed expert, albeit an eminent expert. In the Court’s view, there is strong evidence that the plaintiff has near-term financial need for interim provision for medical treatment with Daratumumab, which she needs.\\n32. Some options to facilitate the payment of an interim family provision order have been canvassed in argument. The Court raised the possibility of charging estate property with the payment of interim provision, perhaps using Succession Act, s 66. The existence of the Court’s charge could potentially be used to raise the funds with a financier organised, if not by the defendants, then by the plaintiff. Mr Goldberg, the solicitor for the plaintiff, rejected this idea on the basis that his firm did not raise money for clients, and the defendant should already have the resources to raise the funds required. The example the Court gave would not necessarily mean that the plaintiff’s firm would need to raise the money: that is a task that could perhaps be outsourced.\\n33. Mr Goldberg points to the fact that the defendants have at least one significant piece of land that is unencumbered at Dundas, and that they could easily raise the funds on that land should they wish to do so. Mr Goldberg says that raising the funds is the responsibility of the defendants, whose property is only very lightly geared. But this unencumbered land at Dundas is owned by the second defendant, and is not part of the estate. The plaintiff says it is potentially able to be designated as notional estate. But if it comes to a contest the parties may be at issue, as to whether an interim family provision order can be made against notional estate.\\n\\n\\nConsideration\\n34. The plaintiff is an eligible person. Her evidence establishes to the level required for an interim order, that she is a person of demonstrable financial need. She has received nothing from the substantial estate of her father, the deceased. The general quality of her relationship with the deceased seems not to be significantly in issue. The Court concludes on the evidence that it is likely that given her overall demonstrated need she will be likely to receive no less provision than $220,206.62 at final hearing. There is jurisdiction to make an interim family provision order for the plaintiff in these proceedings.\\n35. The contest about the timing of the interim provision came down to two issues. First, the defendant submitted that the plaintiff did not need the medical treatment for which the interim provision was claimed. And second, the defendant submitted that the estate was unable to raise the funds to pay the interim provision before 31 January 2022. These reasons consider both these issues.\\n36. As to the plaintiff’s need for medical treatment, the Court has reasoned above that it regards the medical evidence as sufficient to justify the plaintiff’s claim for interim provision to cover her medical expenses. But even if the plaintiff’s case linking her claim for interim provision with an immediate need to cover medical expenses was weaker than it in fact is authorities such as Salkeld make clear that orders for interim provision can be made for purposes other than making provision for immediate maintenance. Even if the defendants’ case, put at its highest and contrary to what the Court has inferred, were made out and the Court found that the plaintiff’s need for the Daratumumab treatment is doubtful, interim provision could still be justified on the basis that it would enable her to keep her medical options open in the medical uncertainty in which she finds herself.\\n37. As to the defendants’ capacity to raise the funds, the Court will order the provision of the $180,000 of requested interim provision by 1 December 2021. This is $160,000 for the Daratumumab and $20,000 for other general expenses.\\n38. The defendant has just under a month to raise $180,000 on existing property. Despite her illness, with the assistance of her solicitor, it does not seem objectively to be an unusually demanding task for the first defendant to approach her existing bankers to raise funds on estate properties by 1 December 2021 for the interim provision being requested. The Court does not readily accept that the funds cannot be raised through the estate’s existing bankers or other financiers by that time, given the amount of the interim provision being sought, and the size of the estate and the time available to the estate to raise the funds. The defendants do not advance evidence of approaches to their bankers for short term finance having already been rejected.\\n39. The Court has decided to adjourn this application to the week commencing Monday, 6 December 2021 with a listing of no more than one hour at a time to be arranged between the parties and with my Chambers. The Court will review whether the defendant has complied with these orders. If the defendant has complied with the orders, then the Motion for interim provision can be finalised by consent.\\n40. If by the week commencing 6 December 2021, the defendant has not complied with the orders, the Court will address the question of what supplementary orders, if any, should be made to enable the plaintiff to have the benefit of the interim provision ordered today. If there is default in relation to order for payment for provision by 1 December 2021, the Court expects the plaintiff to come to the Court with a concrete thought-out proposal and a precise prayer for relief, as to how the funds can be raised by the estate, or the plaintiff with the assistance of the estate, to meet the plaintiff’s needs to pay for her medical treatment.\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Orders\\n41. For these reasons, the Court makes the following orders, notations and directions:\\n         1. Subject to Order (3), order the first defendant to pay the sum of $220,206.62 to the plaintiff by way of an interim family provision order pursuant to Succession Act 2006, s 62 (“the interim provision”);\\n         2. Order that the first defendant pay the interim provision as follows:\\n             1. As to the sum of $20,000, on or before 22 November 2021;\\n             2. As to the sum of $160,000 by 1 December 2021;\\n             3. As to the sum of $40,206.26, on or before 31 January 2022;\\n         3. Orders (1) and (2) are subject to the proviso that if the plaintiff is unsuccessful in the proceedings against the first defendant then the plaintiff will repay to the first defendant the sums paid pursuant to Orders (1) and (2);\\n         4. Note the undertaking of the defendants to the Court not to take any action to evict or remove the plaintiff from her residence at [residential address redacted from publication] during the pendency of these proceedings, including the pendency of any appeal that might be lodged from any award or judgment in respect of them;\\n         5. Order the defendants to pay the plaintiff’s costs of and incidental to the plaintiff’s application for interim provision;\\n         6. Order the defendants to pay the plaintiff’s costs thrown away by reason of the orders made by the Court on 26 October 2021 vacating the hearing date commencing on 8 November 2021, as agreed or assessed;\\n         7. Adjourn these proceedings to a date to be fixed by arrangement with the Associate to Slattery J and reserve for further consideration on that date issues of the enforcement of Orders (1) and (2) if the first defendant defaults on those orders; and\\n         8.

The deceased was survived by his defacto spouse the defendant, his two daughters of that relationship Peta and Franchesca and his daughter Nicole, the plaintiff in the proceedings. Nicole is the daughter of the deceased and Tracey Klein with whom the deceased lived between 1976 and mid 1980.\\n\\n\\n  2 Under his will made 1 November 1993 the deceased gave the whole of his estate to the defendant and appointed her executrix.\\n\\n\\n  3 The estate consists of unit 17/164 Bondi Road, Bondi. There is evidence of the value and after allowing for selling expenses one would expect the amount to be in the order of $145,000.\\n\\n\\n  4 There is money in an account and after payment of costs of commission the amount remaining is $8,799, a total of $153,799.\\n\\n\\n  5 Unfortunately in this matter costs have been incurred. The defendant\\'s costs amount to $20,000 and those of the plaintiff $22,344. There are also airfares for the plaintiff and her mother who gave evidence of some $3,020. Accordingly the net distributable estate if orders were made in the usual terms would be $128,425.\\n\\n\\n  6 The other assets involved are the house at 112 Beach Road, Bondi that was owned by the deceased and the defendant as joint tenants which has passed by survivorship to the defendant. It has a value in the range of $550,000 to $600,000. There are also three trust accounts, two of which were in the deceased\\'s name. One was an investment with St George in the name of the deceased in trust for his daughter Franchesca in the sum of $130,000. The other was a deposit in the Commonwealth Bank in a term deposit in the name of the deceased in trust for Peta in the sum of $50,000. Although it was not referred to in the defendant\\'s affidavit specifically, it transpired in cross-examination that there was also another deposit in the St George Bank in the name of the defendant. That was in trust for both Peta and Franchesca in the amount of $58,000 but which has now reduced down to $38,000.\\n\\n\\n  7 I refer to some of the history in the matter in order to put the matter into context. It was in 1968 that the deceased and his brother Paul Holeva arrived in Australia from Czechoslovakia. In 1976 Tracey Klein and the deceased commenced living together first in a flat at Rose Bay and later in Bondi. The plaintiff was born on 13 November 1978. In about the middle of 1980 the deceased and the plaintiff\\'s mother separated, the plaintiff then being about twenty-one months old.\\n\\n\\n  8 In January the next year, 1981, the deceased and the defendant commenced to live together. They had a child Peta born on 14 June 1982. Not long after her birth the defendant and the deceased separated and remained separated for some four years. At the end of 1982 in November the plaintiff and her mother left Australia for the USA and took up permanent residence in the United States. The circumstances in which they left caused the deceased some hurt but that is not a matter which is the fault of the plaintiff. The plaintiff at that stage was aged four years. In due course the plaintiff\\'s mother married Mr Weaver in 1982 although that marriage only lasted several years.\\n\\n\\n  9 It was in 1986 that the deceased and the defendant resumed their cohabitation and in November of that year they purchased the property at Beach Road Bondi having sold the house they had at Paddington. On 18 February 1987 the deceased and defendant\\'s second daughter Franchesca was born. She is now aged twelve. On 1 November 1993 the deceased executed and published his last will and he died on 24 March 1997.\\n\\n\\n  10 By May of 1997 the plaintiff had completed her education at Douglas High School and in August of that year her mother married Mr Klein. In August the plaintiff commenced her Bachelor\\'s Degree at Birmingham Southern College, Birmingham Alabama. She studies English and Art. In due course probate was granted and these proceedings were commenced.\\n\\n\\n  11 In applications under the Family Provision Act the High Court has recently in Singer v Berghouse (1994) 181 CLR set out a two stage approach that a Court must take. At page 209 it said the following:\\n              \"The first question is, was the provision (if any) made for the applicant \\'inadequate for (his or her) proper maintenance, education and advancement in life\\'? The difference between \\'adequate\\' and \\'proper\\' and the interrelationship which exists between \\'adequate provision\\' and \\'proper maintenance\\' etc were explained in Bosch v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited. The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was inadequate or what, in all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for the having regard, amongst other things, to the applicant\\'s financial position, the size and nature of the deceased\\'s estate, the totality of the relationship between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon his or her bounty.\\n\\n\\n              The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar considerations. Indeed, in the first stage of the process, the court may need to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what is adequate provision, in which event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the order which should be made in favour of the applicant. In saying that, we are mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court could refuse to make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left without adequate provision for proper maintenance. Take, for example, a case like Ellis v Leeder where there were no assets from which an order could reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator\\'s arrangements to pay creditors.\"\\n  12 Having regard to what is said by the High Court it is necessary to look at the plaintiff\\'s situation. The plaintiff herself has no assets of any substance. She is presently twenty-two years of age and she is two years into a four year degree course. Apart from completing this degree course she wishes to do a Master’s degree for two years at Graduate school. The purpose of this is to enable her to attain a teaching qualification and it would seem to be a necessary progression from the basic degree which she is presently studying. She has had a number of expenses at the moment in respect of her education. They are, firstly, her tuition fees of US$13,750 and an activity fee of US$210. She shares a flat with a friend and the expenses and utilities are in the order of US$5,640. She has expenses for food at $40 per week, a total of US$2,080. This is a total living and education expense of US$21,680.\\n\\n\\n  13 However, she has been able to obtain grants and scholarships and her grant amounts to US$5,850 per year. Her income from her part-time work is some $4,200. There is thus a shortfall of US$11,630 for her various expenditures. She has, in the past, borrowed for fees and has loans of approximately $13,020 which will have to be paid when she completes her course. If she continues to borrow during the course of her education she would be likely to have a sum in the order of A$45,000 to pay at the end of her course.\\n\\n\\n  14 Clearly the plaintiff works hard to support herself at college and she still needs the assistance of her mother and stepfather to make ends meet. Her mother and stepfather live in Horton Alabama in the USA. Their circumstances are modest. They both work in a drug store which the stepfather operates and between them they draw a total wage of about US$30,000 per annum.\\n\\n\\n  15 Their assets are as follows; the plaintiff\\'s mother has the house which she bought in the United States in Alabama which is worth about US$42,000. She has had a loan on that which will be paid out in September next year and that loan at the moment is about $6,000. She has an old car and some personal effects.\\n\\n\\n  16 Her husband owns the home which they occupy in Horton Alabama worth about US$40,000 which has a loan of some US$4800. The drug shop is valued at approximately US$108,000 and there are two motor vehicles which the stepfather has.\\n\\n\\n  17 The contact between the plaintiff and the deceased is, of course, an important matter. The plaintiff moved to the United States from Australia when she was four in circumstances as I have indicated before. There was, however, communication between the deceased and the plaintiff. He used to write to her on birthdays and at Christmas, apart from a few odd occasions when she had moved. At times she was sent a small gift such as earrings and occasionally amounts of $100 on these occasions.\\n\\n\\n  18 Clearly the plaintiff responded to this communication from her father. She would send him photos and on at least one occasion when she was growing up, she thinks when she was seven, she spoke to him on the phone. The fact that she wished to see her father is evident in plans she made in 1996 when she planned to come to Australia. Apparently her father indicated that he would try and help her financially to come out but her mother agreed to pay her return airfare and the plan was to come at Christmas 1997. Although she wrote in 1997, the plaintiff did not hear from her father for six months. In October she found out from a friend that her father had died in March 1997. The circumstances of that must have been a shock to the plaintiff but in due course they did come for a holiday.\\n\\n\\n  19 The contact clearly is one which was reciprocated by the plaintiff during the period prior to the death of the deceased. Whether the plaintiff has been left without adequate and proper means for education and maintenance in life is quite clear because she is at a crucial stage in her education. She has had a real need for assistance. She is doing everything she can to get herself through college. Her need over the next four years, putting aside the assistance she gets from her parents approximates $70,000. Even with this she will still have her present debts of US$13,020 which will have to be paid off.\\n\\n\\n  20 It is, of course, necessary to consider the position of others who have a claim on the bounty of the deceased. These are Franchesca, Peta and the defendant.\\n\\n\\n  21 Peta is seventeen and will finish school in the year 2000. She then wishes to go to the University of New South Wales.\\n\\n\\n  22 Franchesca is aged twelve and is in year seven at the local Holy Cross school. She wishes to go to Kambala possibly as a boarder although that is not necessary. She lives with her mother near the school. Apart from the trust fund of $215,000, they have no assets.\\n\\n\\n  23 The defendant\\'s situation certainly is not secure. By way of assets she has the house at Bondi valued at $550,000 to $600,000. The house is adequate for her needs and the needs of her daughters and there is no suggestion that there should be any change in this housing arrangement. She also has the flat which is presently providing an income of $15,000. If it were sold it would realise $145,000. She has something in excess of $10,000 in shares. Her income situation is not good. Her wage amounts to $19,760. The interest on the other two trust accounts as $8,794 and the rental is $7,800 which is a total of $36,354. She also gets interest from the $35,000 investment which would probably amount to $1,750 per annum. After tax this leaves her with income of $460 per week. Her expenses, including the childrens\\' expenses, are $30,854.85 per annum. She is clearly not making ends meet. This is borne out by the fact that she has used $20,000 of funds over the last two and a half years and has done so by using the capital in the account in her name. Her real needs in the future relate to meeting her daughters\\' education.\\n\\n\\n  24 So far as Peta is concerned there is $50,000 in a trust fund and this is clearly sufficient to unable her to complete her University education comfortably.\\n\\n\\n  25 Franchesca wants to go to Kambala. The deceased and the defendant talked of this prior to the deceased\\'s death and clearly it is a reasonable desire on their part. The fees for Kambala presently at the moment range up to $10,000 per annum by the year 12 and if she boarded there would be another $10,000 per annum. Obviously at Franchesca\\'s present age the fees are somewhat less. The suggestion of boarding apparently came from Franchesca but there is no reason why it is necessary. In fact no serious reasons as to why she should board have been put forward. Clearly the $130,000 will be sufficient to enable Franchesca to complete schooling and also attend University if she wishes.\\n\\n\\n  26 The defendant works part-time. It is approximately twenty-four hours a week that she averages and she works as a sales assistant. Her income potential in this regard is limited because she has no other experience or background training. She is fifty years of age and her present employer is going through difficulties in the business and is likely to close. However, it is obvious to me that the defendant is certainly a capable woman and I think, notwithstanding her age, she would be able to get employment as the business closes down. As her children get older she will be able to work more. She would also like to buy a carport for some $24,000 for a car which was recently damaged in a hail storm.\\n\\n\\n  27 The case is really quite a difficult one. Widow\\'s claims are frequently the subject of applications in this Court. Although the defendant does not have to justify the provisions in the will, consideration of a widow\\'s claim is useful in order to set in context the proper considerations.\\n\\n\\n  28 The Court of Appeal in Goloski V Goloski (unreported 5 October 1993) has referred to formulations of this standard to be expected in respect of a widow in terms which refer to a decision of Powell in Luciano v Rosenblum (1985) 2 NSWLR 65 and Elliot v Elliot, which was approved by the Court of Appeal on 24 April 1986. There his Honour said:\\n              \"Where the marriage of a deceased and his widow has been long and harmonious, where the widow has loyally supported her husband and assisted him to build up and maintain his estate, the duty which a deceased owes to his widow can be no less than to the extent to which his assets permit him to achieve that result; first to ensure that his widow be secure in her home for the rest of her life and that if either the need arises or the whim strikes her she have the capacity to change her home; secondly that she have available to her an income sufficient to enable her to live in a reasonable degree of comfort and free from any financial worry; and, third, that she have available to her a fund to which she might have resort in order to provide herself with such modest luxuries as she might choose and which would provide her with a hedge against any unforeseen contingency or disaster that life might bring\".\\n  29 In the present case the length of the relationship between the deceased and the plaintiff has gone for some twelve years. There was a break in it for a period of four years while the parties separated. Apart from this, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the relationship was not happy. Although it is of a reasonable duration, it is not probably the type of length of relationship which was being referred to by his Honour in the quote to which I have just referred.\\n\\n\\n  30 An important point, however, in the defendant\\'s favour is that she has contributed substantially to the house. Originally the defendant had a property in Paddington which was in her name. She had purchased it for $31,000 and in order to make the deceased more comfortable and secure she had placed it in his name without receiving any payment. At that stage the mortgage was about $27,000 and she and the deceased continued to pay it off. When they got back together again they sold the property at Paddington and purchased the beach house property at Bondi for $148,000. The source of the financing for that were $85,000 from the proceeds of Paddington, $40,000 from the parties\\' joint savings and $23,000 as a gift from the defendant\\'s father.\\n\\n\\n  31 So far as the other assets are concerned, and these of course are the flat and the $215,000 in trust, there is little evidence as to how these were accumulated, presumably by the deceased and the defendant. An important aspect is that these funds were held in trust for Peta and Franchesca. This really allows the burden of their education and maintenance over the next few years to be accommodated. It will require capital to be used from time to time but it is sufficient. Importantly they were intended by the deceased and the defendant to be used for that purpose.\\n\\n\\n  32 Here we are not dealing with a claim of a child which is based upon what is sometimes referred to in cases as a matter of paternity. The plaintiff was separated from the deceased at an early age but this was not her fault. There was communication throughout the child\\'s life. It was a two way matter. Indeed Franchesca and Peta frequently wrote, no doubt encouraged by their father, the deceased. There were also the plans for the major trip to reunite the plaintiff with her father. These are not insignificant. Yet the deceased has not recognised the plaintiff in his will. This treatment of the plaintiff is in marked contrast with the way the deceased treated his own children during his relationship with the defendant in his life time when he put substantial sums away for their future education at his own expense.\\n\\n\\n  33 I do not suggest there should have been equal treatment between the three girls. The sad fact is the plaintiff has been for the majority of her life part of another family unit. Her own mother has responsibility towards her. The difficulty is with the position of the defendant. Fortunately, she has the unit. Given the level of the legacy, I am considering she will have the option of mortgaging that unit or selling it to meet the legacy and costs.\\n\\n\\n  34 It seems to me that the appropriate order, balancing all the considerations and evidence, most of which I have referred to, require that there be a legacy in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $35,000.\\n\\n\\n  35 Accordingly, I order that the plaintiff receive out of the estate of the deceased a legacy of $35,000.\\n\\n\\n  36 So far as costs are concerned, there have been tendered some letters concerning the need for the plaintiff and her mother to come to Australia. I do not think it is appropriate that I should resolve that matter. It is really a matter for the costs assessor in due course.\\n\\n\\n  37 Accordingly, I order the costs of the plaintiff on a party and party basis and the defendant on an indemnity basis be paid or retained out of the estate of the deceased.\\n\\n\\n\\nLast Modified: 10/13/1999\\nDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.
