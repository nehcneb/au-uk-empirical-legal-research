This webpage contains the Python code for the Empirical Legal Research Kickstarter (available at https://empirical-legal-research.streamlit.app).

The file entitled "Home.py" has the code for the home page. The codes for the individual subpages are placed in the "pages" folder. These codes import functions defined in 
"common_functions.py" and "gpt_functions.py".

Please don't hesitate to reach out to Ben Chen at ben.chen@sydney.edu.au should you have any enquiries.
